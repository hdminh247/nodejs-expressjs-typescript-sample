        title: '2019 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT Review',
        image: `news1.jpg`,
        content: 'Dodge created the progenitor to the modern-day minivan back in the 1980s. That design has evolved over time with newer and newer generations. However, today it has one of the oldest minivan designs on sale. The 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan that I drove is a decade-old design. That doesnt stop it from being an important model.Honda, Toyota, Kia, and Chrysler all have newer designs, but the Dodge Grand Caravan sells far greater than any of them. Much of that goes to fleets, but it doesnt change the fact that the Grand Caravan sells pretty well. The models sales are down this year by quite a lot, but in terms of overall volume, its the clear winner in the segment.To find out why I decided to take the vehicle on a nice spin around Oregon. I had the chance to go out that way for a Chevrolet Silverado Diesel and Silverado HD drive. What I found surprised me—a more than decade-old design still delivers.What Is It?The Dodge Grand Caravan is the value proposition in the minivan segment. It offers all of the minivan essentials, like power sliding doors and a rear power liftgate as well as a generous storage area and plenty of interior room for a price lower than the competition. While the Grand Caravan might be the value proposition in the segment and lacks some of the features and amenities of its competition, it still manages to deliver a good experience. Theres plenty of room inside the cabin, the powertrain is proven after years of use, and the cargo area will let you do everything you need or want to do with a minivan. A Competent PowertrainUnder the hood of the Grand Caravan is FCAs venerable 3.6-liter V6 engine. In the Grand Caravan, it produces 283 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. This engine is used in all sorts of vehicles across Dodges lineup and in FCAs other brands. Its a great engine, albeit nothing special. The V6 makes the minivan capable of towing up to 3,600 lbs. The EPA has rated the V6 at 17 mpg city and 25 mpg highway. Thats certainly not segment-leading—Honda and Chrylsers models do better—but its not wildly far off. The engine moves the vehicle along perfectly fine. I drove the minivan in the mountains around Bend, Oregon. The six-speed automatic transmission did a fine job, but youll never mistake this powertrain for powerful – or the van for fast. Its good for what its meant to do—move people around at reasonable speeds and cruise easily on the highway. A Non-Offensive ExteriorThe minivan exterior has always been hard to pull off well. With that said, I think Dodge does a decent job with the Grand Caravan, especially considering the design is so old. There were updates to the design in 2011 and 2014, and these proved helpful towards keeping the Grand Caravan from going completely stale. Dodge makes no bold style statements with the Grand Caravan. What you see is what you get. While Hondas Odyssey has some interesting lines, the Grand Caravan is pretty simple. I actually prefer this. I know its a minivan. Dont try to make it cool or make it look like something its not.Theres not much to point to on the exterior of the vehicle that stands out. Dodge does a good job of keeping things vanilla. This is a smart move. Its lack of polarizing style means its a good middle of the road option. Cheaper Feeling Interior With Some Good FeaturesTheres a lot to complain about with the interior of the Dodge Grand Caravan. There are cheap plastics throughout the vehicle and the seats themselves could be a little comfier. Theyre a little on the firm and flat side. Overall, most of the vehicles Ive driven in the last few years have felt and looked better. The interior of the Chrysler Pacifica is leaps and bounds better and the cabins of the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna are far better, too. That said, everything felt reasonably sturdy and ready for the rigors of minivan life. You wont care about spills, people getting sick, or you kids kicking things. Yes, cleaning up is a pain, especially because theres no handy built-in vacuum like in other minivans. However, you wont be worried about all of the family caused grime and foodstuffs that come along. Youll just hopefully dig out the shop vac once a month and do a good deep clean.The one standout feature of the Grand Caravan is the Stow ‘n Go seating. The second-row seats fold up and disappear leaving a flat loading floor. The rear cargo area also has a recess and those seats fold away, leaving a completely flat loading floor. This makes the vehicle extremely handy.Other minivans do this kind of magic trick, too, but they cost a little more. Its nice to know you can get this kind of wonderful functionality for a bargain price. When it comes to technology, the Grand Caravan is way behind the curve. You get a 6.5-inch touchscreen with some buttons to either side and a couple of knobs. Its easy to use but looks dated and lacks many advanced features its competitors have. With that said, it does include satellite radio, Bluetooth, and navigation. You can also get a DVD player for the rear passengers that can also be used for gaming systems. All that sounds fine, but the vehicle lacks the copious USB ports, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and all the other goodies from other automakers. Again, content is limited when you go with a price this low. How Big Is It?The Grand Caravan measures 202.8 inches long, 78.7 inches wide, and 68.9 inches high. When compared with the competition, the minivan is right on par. The Chrysler Pacifica is a little bit bigger, but only by an inch or so. The Honda Odyssey is about the same and the Kia Sedona and Toyota Sienna are actually a little bit smaller. Inside, Dodges minivan provides 40.7 inches of legroom for the front row, 36.5 inches for the second row, and 32.7 inches in the third. The front row is on par with all of the competition, but the second row and third row dont do as well. The Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, and Kia all do better in these areas. Some by a couple of inches others by a few. When it comes to cargo volume, the Grand Caravan has 31.1 cubic feet of space with all seats in place. Fold the third-row seats and youre looking at 78.9 cubic feet. Fold the third and second rows, and you have 140.3 cubic feet of total cargo space and a flat loading floor. All of the Grand Caravans competitors do a better job but only by a few cubic feet at the most. In some cases, though, that can make all the difference. Does It Work?In a word, yes. The Dodge Grand Caravan gets the job done. It will move large families around with ease. There are power doors, seating for up to seven people, plenty of cargo room, and good storage in the cabin. The driver and front passenger have access to more cubbies and bins than theyll likely know what to do with. I actually like the layout of the interior storage areas better than the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna.When you think about what a minivan must do at a minimum, the Dodge Grand Caravan delivers. However, there are some concerns.First off, is the fact that the interior of the vehicle feels and looks cheap. I said it felt sturdy and ready to take on the rigors of family life above. I believe it would fare rather well. That said, I do worry about how it would hold up over many years of use. I think it would be good for about five years, mind you, but thats a total guess.With the average age of cars on the road creeping towards 12 years, according to USA Today, I worry that the Grand Caravan might not be up to a dozen years or more at the unforgiving hands of your children. Secondly, with automotive technology and smartphone technology moving so fast, the already dated tech in the Grand Caravan means youll be living in the dark ages before you know it. This is fine if you dont mind that, but for anyone who likes to keep up with the times, a newer design would suit you better. Those are the two big complaints of the model. I could nitpick about how the engine isnt as fuel-efficient as competitors, or the fact that the cargo and interior volume isnt quite as good, but the first two complaints are far more important. Does It Justify Its Price?Judging by my comments above, you might expect I would recommend other minivans. The answer is yes if you have the money. If youre on a tighter budget or dont care about the technology in newer models, then the Grand Caravan does justify its price. This vehicle comes in with a price tag of $27,040. Thats a reasonable sum for something so useful. Thats cheaper than all of the competition. Its not a ton cheaper when you look at just the base models, but if you climb the ladder a bit, youll notice that the price difference becomes wider. This means the Grand Caravan is a better deal at a higher trim level. If however, you were going to buy a low trim level, you might want to look at the Kia Sedona or the Chrysler Pacifica, which are both much newer designs but come at only a slightly higher price tag in the lower trim levels. Whats the Verdict?Im not much of a minivan guy, but I came away from my time with the Grand Caravan appreciating the vehicle for what it is—a simple cargo and people mover. At that mission, it performs well. Its not the fanciest minivan out there, and you can get a newer design for only a little bit more money, but the Grand Caravan does have a place in the market.That place is at the bottom of the minivan pricing ladder and at the top of the high-value spectrum. This recipe yields good sales results for the company. Dodges aging model still has some life left in it. Its not a super special vehicle, but it is worth the money Dodge asks for it, and thats why its still around and still selling.SpecificationsBase Price: $27,040Price as Tested: Not availableDrive Type: Front-wheel driveEngine: 3.6-liter V6Transmission: 6-speed automaticPower Output: 283 hp and 260 lb-ft of torqueEPA: 17 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, 20 mpg combinedOptional Equipment: Not available',

        content: 'At the Super Trofeo World Finals at the Jerez de la Frontera Circuit in Spain, where world-class athletes put their driving skills to the test in the big kid toys, Lamborghini unveiled two brand-new toys for everybody that are set to launch in 2020. The Huracán Super Trofeo EVO and Urus ST-X are paired for the next Lego Speed Champions set.The Huracán Super Trofeo EVO is already one of Lamborghinis most popular racing models and competes in the single-make Super Trofeo series. The Urus ST-X is set to compete in track and off-roading competitions starting in October 2020 at the Misano World Final in an all-new race. Now both of these cars will be available for purchase in Lego form. Fortunately, 2020 marks the start of a new chapter for Lego Speed Champions with the evolution to the more accurate ‘8 Studs Wide’ design, and we felt that we could now do the popular brand justice, Lego Speed Champions design manager specialist Chris Stamp said. Especially the wide body of the Huracán Super Trofeo EVO. And with the awesome Urus ST-X we also introduce our first Super SUV into the theme, which fans will hopefully be just as thrilled with as we are.The Huracán model includes realistic parallels such as the shark fin, air scoop, front diffuser and large wing. It features a black scheme with slick accents and advertising sponsors. The set is 659 pieces in total and also includes starting lights and two figurines. Though pricing is yet to be released, the set will be available starting January 1, 2020. Seems like a missed Christmas opportunity, no?',

        content: 'At SEMA next week, Honda will celebrate 60 years in the U.S. by bringing along a few tricked-out SUVs and trucks like the CR-V and a concept Ridgeline geared toward veering off the paved road.The centerpiece will be a pair of 2020 CR-Vs — one the slightly refreshed combustion version, the other the all-new two-motor Hybrid variant. Both builds are by Jsport Performance Accessories, done in respective “overlander” and “weekend warrior” themes.The overlander “Dream” build comes in a topographic map paint scheme. It includes a 1.5-inch lift, side steps, front bumper, rear tire gate and a modular roof rack from Jsport, plus 17-inch off-road wheels with all-terrain tires. The cargo area gets an organization cabinet and nifty slide-out fridge, while the whole thing is topped off by a Roofnest Falcon clamshell tent.Meanwhile the CR-V Hybrid “Do” build gets the same lift kit package, wheels and Nitto Ridge Grappler tires, plus a Jsport roof basket with a Cannondale mountain bike mounted atop for show.Honda Factory Performance will show its Ridgeline HFP Concept, a lifted version of the standard pickup with a widened stance, though just how much either measurement is increased Honda does not say. It has all-terrain tires wrapping 18-inch concept bronze-finish HFP alloy wheels and various Honda accessories. There’s also a bed rack from Thule, custom Fuji mountain bikes and a Siberian camo tent from Kukenam.Honda’s Ohio R&D unit will show off the 2019 Rally Passport it built as a private, after-hours project to compete in stage rally competition in the American Rally Association’s Limited 4WD class, where it placed second in class and 12th overall in the Southern Ohio Forest Rally. Modification features include a roll cage and other safety equipment, Maxxis RAZR MT Tires on Braid Wheels, Carbotech brake pads, front and rear skid plates, and a hand-operated hydraulic brake.Honda will also display the restored 1961 Chevrolet Apache pickup that it used to deliver motorcycles to dealers in its early days, and have several cars and motorcycles on display at SEMA.

        content: 'The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has awarded the 2020 Mercedes-Benz GLE-Class a Top Safety Pick+ designation for models built after July 2019 and optioned with the Exterior Lighting Package. The IIHS said the GLEs standard, static LED headlights only achieved an acceptable rating, below the good rating needed for the + designation. The $900 package adds adaptive LED lights providing active curve illumination and automatic high beams. The Volkswagen Tiguan earned the same Top Safety Pick+ accolade with the same qualification, except the Tiguan also required an optional front crash prevention system.In that respect, the 2020 GLE not only betters the Tiguan, it betters the 2019 GLE. Mercedes offers two crash prevention systems, a standard Pre-Safe system and an enhanced version in a $2,250 Driver Assistance Package Plus. Only the 2019 GLE with the additional safety package earned a TSP+ award. On the  2020 GLE, the IIHS said even the standard Pre-Safe achieved superior ratings. In the 12-mph impact test, the entry-level Pre-Safe lowered vehicle speed to 2 mph on average before collision, while Pre-Safe Plus avoided the collision. In the 25-mph impact test, Pre-Safe lowered vehicle speed to 11 mph on average at impact, Pre-Safe Plus lowered vehicle speed to 4 mph on average.The 2020 received good ratings in the six other crash tests as part of the criteria, driver-side small overlap front, passenger-side small overlap front, moderate overlap front, side, and roof strength and head restraints.',
